# ENGG-1420-University-Management-System

Final group project for ENGG-1420: Develop a system where students and faculty can view their courses, subjects, and professors, as well as register for events. Administrators will have the ability to modify these details. All data will be stored in a database (Excel sheet).

## Planning

* Use access modifiers to restrict the usage of functions and variables.
  * Prevent them from being used in unintended places.
* Add comments to document the purpose of functions and specify their accessibility.
  * Clarify what should be used and how it works.
* Create a database class.
  * It should read from and write to an Excel file.
  * Design it with compatibility for the manager classes.
* Clarify how events are stored for professors.
  * Update relevant classes based on the specifications.
* Create an authentication function.
  * It should interact with both the faculty and student managers.
